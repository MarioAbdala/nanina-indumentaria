## Description

This is a personal proyect for a website to my family's small shop in my hometown. It is a proyect I will continue to work on for the next couple of months, until I feel it's good enough, and beyond that as well.
This application will become an online shop for this business. The technologies I'm using are React with Typescript, React Router, Vite, among others I will be listing as I go on.
